Hi Claude,
Regarding the Locked Allocations (Founders, Team, Partnerships, Community, Strategic Reserves, Marketing), I want to confirm:

Have you implemented the locking mechanism in the contracts yet?

If yes, please provide the exact vesting logic and control process.

If no, should we plan and implement this mechanism before deploying?

Please propose a detailed plan for how we will manage locked tokens, including:

Wallet control structure (multi-sig, admin wallets, etc.)

Unlock schedule logic

Mechanism for sending locked/unlocked tokens

Any necessary changes to contracts and deployment scripts

I want to review and approve this plan before any implementation begins.
